Maintenance Analysis Tool
This repository contains code for analyzing maintenance strategies for machines using Kaplan-Meier estimation, Weibull distribution fitting, and Maintenance policies evaluation.

Introduction
As part of Asset Management, selecting the right maintenance strategy is crucial for ensuring equipment reliability and minimizing downtime. This project focuses on analyzing maintenance strategies for three machines using data-driven approaches.

Overview
The analysis includes:

Calculation of Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) using Kaplan-Meier and Weibull methods.
Evaluation of maintenance policies: Corrective Maintenance (CM), Time-Based Maintenance (TBM), and Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM).
Visualization of reliability functions and cost rates for different maintenance strategies.

**Maintenance Policies**
Corrective Maintenance (CM):
In CM, maintenance is performed only after a machine failure occurs.

Time-Based Maintenance (TBM):
In TBM, maintenance is performed periodically regardless of the machine's condition.

Condition-Based Maintenance (CBM):
In CBM, maintenance is performed based on the machine's condition, using predefined thresholds.

Results:
The analysis results include MTBF estimates, optimal maintenance policies, and cost savings compared to CM or TBM policies for each machine.
